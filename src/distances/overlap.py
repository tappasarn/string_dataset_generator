"""
This module calculate overlap of the generate data set

'overlap' is defined as if a point in cluster A has the distance to its medoids further that the distance of its closest member from other clusters

parameters:
* data : artificially generated data set as a list of numpy array containing strings
* ground_truths : (numpy array) ground truth of the data set
* representatives : list of numpy array (cluster representative / medoids)
